      <h2 class="mb-3">The Ancient Bristlecone Pines</h2>
      <p>
        The Great Basin Bristlecone Pines (Pinus longaeva) are among the oldest living trees on Earth, with some
        specimens exceeding 5,000 years of age. These ancient trees have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations,
        surviving in the harsh and arid conditions of the western United States. Their resilience and longevity are a
        testament to nature's tenacity and adaptability.

      <h2 class="mb-3">Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        Despite their resilience, Bristlecone Pines are not immune to the impacts of climate change, pests, fire, and
        human activity. Our project aims to assess the risk to Bristlecone Pine groves from these factors, providing a
        comprehensive and data-driven tool to aid in their conservation.

      <h2 class="mb-3">Our Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        We developed a risk scoring system based on five key factors: climate change (temperature and precipitation),
        pest infestation, fire risk, and proximity to human activity. Each factor was scored on a scale from 0 (no risk)
        to 5 (very high risk), with the final risk score for each grove being a weighted sum of these factors. The
        weights were determined based on the relative impact of each factor on Bristlecone Pine health and survival, as
        supported by scientific research.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data for these factors was sourced from various scientific databases and processed using GIS software. The
        resulting risk scores were then visualized on a map, providing a clear and intuitive representation of the risk
        to each Bristlecone Pine grove.

      <h2 class="mb-3">The Risk Map</h2>
      <p>
        The risk map is a powerful tool for visualizing the spatial distribution of risk to Bristlecone Pine groves.
        Each grove is represented by a polygon, colored according to its risk score. This allows for easy identification
        of high-risk areas, aiding in conservation planning and resource allocation.
